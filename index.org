* Welcome to my Homepage

  I never thought i would create another after years of absence but using emacs and Nikola makes it quite comfortable again :-)
  On this page i want to share the stuff and topics i stumble upon my journey through live. These can be anything but most likely
  tech topics about linux, ricing my desktop, emacs/orgmode which i use to create this site and maybe my other personal projects.

** Not much to see yet 
   As i just created the site it will possibly take a while before worth sharing and will change in look and structure often.
   Feel free to come back later :-)


** Here are my latests blog posts :
